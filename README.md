## HOW IT WORKS

On the home page, users will need to sign in before posting or buying any article. Have they decided not to sign in they can still tour the site and contemplate the beautiful and unique items we have.

Once they sign in they can search through a variety of items, from..... to.... and eventually make their choice. They can save their items to the cart, continue shopping and complete their purchase by checking out if they choose to. 

Users can also post item for sale. To do so, they just need to fill out the form and the item will be listed for purchase. They can still delete the items whenever they want. The stock will reflect the change for any entry or sale.


## FUTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

The app can be upgraded to incorporate features and tools to help manage the store. Managers could have access to the inventory at any point in time, total sale by department etc.
